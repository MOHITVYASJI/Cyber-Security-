## 📘 Definitions

- *CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)*: A standard method to assign severity scores (0-10)
- *False Positive*: When a tool detects a vulnerability that is not actually present
- *Vulnerability Scanning vs. Penetration Testing*:
  - Scanning: Automated check for known vulnerabilities
  - Pen Testing: Manual exploitation of real weaknesses
