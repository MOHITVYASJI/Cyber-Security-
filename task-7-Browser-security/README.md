## 🧠 Objective
The goal of this task was to explore installed browser extensions, evaluate their trustworthiness, and remove any potentially harmful or unnecessary ones — gaining awareness of browser-based security risks in the process.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- 🌐 Google Chrome (or any modern browser)
- 🔎 Manual extension review
- 📖 Chrome Web Store for reviews and permissions info

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Opened the browser's *Extensions Manager* via:
   - chrome://extensions/ (for Chrome)
   - about:addons (for Firefox)

2. Reviewed all installed extensions, focusing on:
   - Unusual names
   - Overreaching permissions (like access to all browsing data)
   - Poor ratings or reviews
   - Extensions no longer in use

3. Identified suspicious or unnecessary extensions

4. Removed those extensions from the browser

5. Restarted the browser to apply changes and verify improved performance

## ❌ Extensions Removed

| Extension Name        | Reason for Removal                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Free VPN for Chrome   | Unverified developer, required full access    |
| PDF Converter Tool    | Not in use, required access to all websites   |

## ✅ Safe Extensions Kept

- Dark Reader
- uBlock Origin
- Screenshot Tool

All had strong reviews, transparent permissions, and were actively used.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Malicious extensions can access sensitive data, track activity, or even hijack browsing sessions.
- Always check *permissions, **reviews, and **developer reputation* before installing.
- It's best to *remove* anything not essential.
- A leaner browser is often a safer and faster one!
