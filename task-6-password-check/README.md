## ✅ What I Did

1. Created passwords of different strength levels:
   - password123
   - Mohit@2025
   - M0h!T_Vya$@927#
   - sunsetraincloud
   - T1m3T0#G0Cr@zY!

3. Collected feedback and strength % from the tools.
4. Researched brute-force & dictionary attacks.
5. Summarized how complexity improves password security.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Strong passwords are:
  - Long (12+ characters)
  - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
  - Unique and not based on personal info

- Weak passwords can be cracked in seconds.
- Using passphrases (like Red$Sky_Waves2025) is better than short random strings.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds another layer of security.
