# 🛡 Task 8: Working with VPNs

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) help protect privacy, secure communication over public networks, and explore their real-world performance through hands-on experience.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- 🔐 [ProtonVPN (Free Tier)](https://protonvpn.com/)
- 🌐 [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) — to verify IP changes
- 🖥 Laptop running Kali Linux (or Windows/Mac)

---

## 🪜 Steps Performed

1. ✅ *Signed up* for a free ProtonVPN account.
2. 📥 *Downloaded & installed* the ProtonVPN client on my system.
3. 🔌 *Connected* to a VPN server (e.g., Netherlands or Singapore).
4. 🌍 Checked *IP address* before and after VPN connection using whatismyipaddress.com.
5. 🔒 Visited a few websites and confirmed *traffic was encrypted*.
6. 📶 *Disconnected* from VPN and noticed slight difference in speed.
7. 📚 Researched the *benefits, limitations, and working* of VPNs.

## 🧾 Connection Status

> ✅ Successfully connected to ProtonVPN (Free Tier)  
> 📍 Server Location: Netherlands  
> 🔐 Encryption Protocol: OpenVPN (AES-256-CBC)  
> 🌐 New IP: 185.xxx.xxx.xxx (different from actual ISP IP)

## 📘 What I Learned

- VPN encrypts internet traffic, protecting data from ISPs, hackers, and trackers.
- A good VPN *masks your IP*, offering better anonymity.
- VPNs can *bypass geo-restrictions* and censorship.
- Some free VPNs *limit speed or data*, and may have fewer servers.
- Encryption protocols like *OpenVPN* and *WireGuard* ensure secure tunnels.

## ❓ Interview Q&A

| Question                              | Answer                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What is a VPN?                       | A VPN is a Virtual Private Network that creates a secure tunnel over the internet. |
| How does it protect privacy?         | By encrypting traffic and hiding your IP address from websites and ISPs. |
| VPN vs Proxy?                        | VPN encrypts all traffic system-wide; proxy works at the application level without encryption. |
| What is VPN encryption?              | It scrambles your data using protocols like OpenVPN, IKEv2, WireGuard. |
| Can it ensure complete anonymity?    | No, but it significantly improves privacy — anonymity also depends on your behavior. |
| What are VPN protocols?              | OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec, L2TP, PPTP. |
| VPN limitations?                     | Reduced speed, limited server access on free plans, possible legal restrictions. |
| VPN and speed impact?                | Some latency and bandwidth reduction due to encryption overhead.      |
